#### 1. Difference between `file format` and `storage system` ? 

- `Fileformat` is different ways describing how the information recorded in files should be stored and read. There is for example different image file formats gif,jpeg and png and they each store images but the information inside the file differs between the different file formats.

- `Filesystem` is the structure and layout of files, directories and links and how this is stored on the disk. File system is a way to represent how the files are stored on a medium. There can even be files, those format is a disk image. And that disk image can have its own file system that is accessible using suitable tools.
